# Migrating from domain-functions

If you are coming from `domain-functions`, you will find that `composable-functions` is a more flexible and powerful and better typed library.
This document will guide you through the migration process.

## Benefits of Migrating from `domain-functions` to `composable-functions`

-	üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Type Safety: Enjoy robust **type-safety during function composition**. The improved type-checking mechanisms prevent incompatible functions from being composed, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.
-	ü§å Simplified Function Creation: **No need to define schemas**. Create composable functions easily and efficiently without the overhead of schema definitions.
-	üïµüèΩ Runtime Validation: Use the `withSchema` function for optional runtime validation of inputs and environments. This provides flexibility to enforce data integrity when needed without mandating it for every function. Assuming you have a big chain of composables you can use `applySchema` to run your runtime validation only once **avoiding unnecessary processing**.
-	üîÄ Flexible Compositions: The new combinators, such as `environment.pipe`, `environment.sequence`, and `environment.branch`, offer powerful ways to manage **typed environments** and contextual information across your compositions.
-	üõ†Ô∏è Incremental Migration: Seamlessly migrate your existing codebase incrementally. **Both `domain-functions` and `composable-functions` can coexist**, allowing you to transition module by module.
-	üõü Enhanced Error Handling Combinators: New and improved combinators like `mapErrors` and `catchFailure` provide more control over error transformation and handling, making your **code more resilient**.

## First steps
The first thing you want to know is that the old `DomainFunction<T>` is equivalent to `Composable<(input?: unknown, environment?: unknwon) => T>`. We brought the arguments to the type signature se we could type check the compositions. A [commonly requested feature](https://github.com/seasonedcc/domain-functions/issues/80) in domain-functions.

A composable does not need a schema, but you can still use one for runtime assertion. What we used to call a Domain Function is now a Composable with [environment](./environments.md) and a schema.

The new constructor `withSchema` will work almost exactly as `makeDomainFunction`, except for the `Result` type of the resulting function.

### The new `Result` type - `Success<T> | Failure`
We removed the inputErrors and environmentErrors from the result and represent all of them using instances of `Error`.

This allows us to preserve stack traces and use the familiar exception interface. To differentiate inputErrors and environmentErrors you can use the `instanceof` operator. It also opens up the possibility create any custom error your system needs.

```ts
// Old ErrorResult:
{
  success: false,
  errors: [{ message: 'Something went wrong' }],
  inputErrors: [{ message: 'Required', path: ['name'] }],
  environemntErrors: [{ message: 'Unauthorized', path: ['user'] }],
}

// New Failure:
{
  success: false,
  errors: [
    new Error('Something went wrong'),
    new InputError('Required', ['name']),
    new EnvironmentError('Unauthorized', ['user']),
  ],
}
```

#### Serialization
The issue with native JS errors is that they lose most information when serialized to JSON.

To solve that, whenever you send a `Result` over the wire you may use the new `serialize` helper that will turn your errors into a friendly object format, similar to the old `ErrorMessage` type:

```ts
const serializedResult = JSON.stringify(serialize({
  success: false,
  errors: [new InputError('Oops', ['name'])],
}))

// serializedResult is:
`"{ success: false, errors: [{ message: 'Oops', name: 'InputError', path: ['name'] }] }"`
```

## Combinators which shouldn't be affected
The parallel combinators like `all` and `collect`, along with `map` and `fromSuccess` should work the same way.

## Sequential combinators and the concept of environment
The environment we used to have in domain-functions is already built-in the composable's parallel combinators since all arguments are forwarded to every function. For a deeper explanation check the [`environment` docs](./environments.md).

When it comes to sequential compositions, however, we need special combinators to preserve the environment so they work as the domain-functions' combinators.

Use the sequential combinators from the namespace `environment` to keep this familiar behavior.

```ts
import { environment } from 'composable-functions'

const result = environment.pipe(fn1, fn2)(input, env)
// same for `environment.sequence` and `environment.branch`
```

**Note**: The `pipe`, `sequence`, and `branch` outside of the `environment` namespace will not keep the environment through the composition.

## Modified combinators
### mapError
The `mapError` was renamed to `mapErrors` function and it now receives and returns an `Array<Error>` instead of an `ErrorData` - which was removed.
Since the new `Failure` is much simpler than `ErrorResult` this change will often lead to simpler code:

```ts
// Old DF code:
import { mapError } from 'domain-functions'

const summarizeErrors = (result: ErrorData) =>
  ({
    errors: [{ message: 'Number of errors: ' + result.errors.length }],
    inputErrors: [
      { message: 'Number of input errors: ' + result.inputErrors.length },
    ],
    environmentErrors: [
      { message: 'Number of environment errors: ' + result.environmentErrors.length },
    ],
  } as ErrorData)

const incrementWithErrorSummary = mapError(increment, summarizeErrors)

// New Composable code:
import { mapErrors, isInputError, isEnvironmentError } from 'composable-functions'

const summarizeErrors = (errors: Error[]) =>
  [
    new Error('Number of errors: ' + errors.filter((e) => !isInputError(e) && !isEnvironmentError(e)).length,
    new InputError('Number of input errors: ' + errors.filter(isInputError).length),
    new EnvironmentError('Number of environment errors: ' + errors.filter(isEnvironmentError).length),
  ]

const incrementWithErrorSummary = mapErrors(increment, summarizeErrors)
```

### trace
The `trace` function would get a function that had `result`, `input`, and `environment` as arguments. Now the only change is that it receives all the arguments given to the function. In domain-functions the arguments were always input and environment but in composable-functions that limitation is gone therefore we can't assure it will always be the same.

```ts
const fn = composable((a: number, b: number, c: number) => a + b + c)
const withTrace = trace((...args) => console.log(...args))(fn)
const result = await withTrace(1, 2, 3)
// This will log: [{ success: true, data: 6, errors: [] }, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Removed combinators
### first
This function was removed because it had a hazardous behavior. It would return the first successful result, but it would run all functions in parallel which could cause unexpected side effects.

Since we introduced `branch` we never had a use case for `first` since we used `first` solely for adding conditional logic in our compositions which `branch` does much better.
We appreciate any feedback on this decision.

### collectSequence
We removed this function because even though ECMAScript guarantees the order of the keys in an object, to get this typing right is very challenging.

If you want similar functionality, you can use `sequence` and `map` to give names to the results like so:

```ts
// instead of
const df = collectSequence({
  name: nameDf,
  age: ageDf,
})

// you can do
const fn = map(sequence(nameDf, ageDf), ([name, age]) => ({ name, age }))
```

### merge
We also removed the `merge` function because it was not a total function which meant that later domain-functions could override the previous ones.

You can easily achieve the same result with the `map` with `all` and `mergeObjects` functions like so:

```ts
// instead of
const df1 = makeDomainFunction()(() => ({ firstName: 'John' }))
const df2 = makeDomainFunction()(() => ({ lastName: 'Doe' }))
const df = merge(df1, df2)
//    ^? DomainFunction<{ firstName: string, lastName: string }>

// you can do
const fn1 = composable(() => ({ firstName: 'John' }))
const fn2 = composable(() => ({ lastName: 'Doe' }))
const fn = map(all(fn1, fn2), mergeObjects)
```

## Incremental migration
You don't need to migrate the whole project at once.
You can have both libraries in the project and migrate one module at a time.

Choose a module that has fewer dependants and swipe all constructors from `makeDomainFunction` to `withSchema`.

If your compositions are using domain functions from other modules, you'll see type errors. You can use the `toComposable` function below to avoid having to migrate those modules.

```ts
function toComposable<T>(df: DomainFunction<T>) {
  return (async (...args) => {
    const result = await df(...args)
    if (result.success) {
      return { success: true, errors: [], data: result.data }
    }
    return {
      success: false,
      errors: [
        ...result.errors.map((e) => e.exception),
        ...result.inputErrors.map(
          ({ message, path }) => new InputError(message, path),
        ),
        ...result.environmentErrors.map(
          ({ message, path }) => new EnvironmentError(message, path),
        ),
      ],
    }
  }) as Composable<(input?: unknown, environment?: unknown) => T>
}
```

Understanding the code above will also help you understand the differences between the two libraries. Once you finish migrating the other modules you can remove the `toComposable` function.

### Dealing with Failures
- In the tests, change the `result.inputErrors` and `result.environmentErrors` for `result.errors`. You can also test for the name: `InputError` or `EnvironmentError`
```ts
// replace this
expect(result.inputErrors).containSubset([{ path: ['name'] }])
// with this
expect(result.errors).containSubset([{ name: 'InputError', path: ['name'] }])
```
- Elsewhere, collect the inputErrors and environmentErrors with functions that look for `error instanceof InputError` or check the `name` of the error if the result was serialized.
